# dfweb-v4 Test Strategy Document

## 1. Introduction

This Test Strategy document outlines the testing approach for the dfweb-v4
project. It defines testing objectives, methodology, scope, and resources
required to effectively validate the application quality and ensure alignment
with ISTQB best practices.

## 2. Test Objectives

- Ensure all functional requirements are validated across multiple test levels
- Verify the application's performance meets established standards
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG standards)
- Validate cross-browser and responsive design compatibility
- Identify and mitigate potential risks early in development
- Support continuous integration/continuous delivery processes

## 3. Testing Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

- Unit testing of React components
- Integration testing of component interactions
- E2E testing of critical user flows
- Performance validation
- Accessibility compliance
- Browser compatibility
- Responsive design verification

### 3.2 Out of Scope

- Security penetration testing (to be handled by a specialized team)
- Stress testing beyond established performance thresholds
- Compatibility with unsupported browsers/versions

## 4. Test Approach

### 4.1 Test Levels

#### 4.1.1 Unit Testing

- **Technology**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Responsible**: Development team
- **Frequency**: On every code change
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% code coverage for components
- **Focus**: Individual component functionality and rendering

#### 4.1.2 Component Testing

- **Technology**: Cypress Component Testing
- **Responsible**: Development team
- **Frequency**: For complex components and interactions
- **Focus**: Component behavior in isolation with all dependencies

#### 4.1.3 End-to-End Testing

- **Technology**: Cypress and Playwright
- **Responsible**: QA team and developers
- **Frequency**: On feature completion and prior to release
- **Focus**: Critical user flows and interactions

### 4.2 Non-Functional Testing

#### 4.2.1 Performance Testing

- **Technology**: Lighthouse CI
- **Responsible**: QA team
- **Frequency**: Weekly and before releases
- **Metrics**: Performance score > 90, FCP < 1.8s, TTI < 3.8s

#### 4.2.2 Accessibility Testing

- **Technology**: pa11y, axe-core
- **Responsible**: Development and QA teams
- **Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Frequency**: On component development and before releases

## 5. Test Environment

- Development: Local environment with Next.js development server
- Testing: Dedicated test environment with mock data
- Staging: Production-like environment with sanitized production data
- Production: Live environment

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

### 6.1 Automation Framework

- Unit/Component: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress Component Testing
- E2E: Cypress, Playwright
- CI Integration: GitHub Actions/Vercel

### 6.2 Automation Guidelines

- Tests should be independent and isolated
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Implement proper data setup and teardown
- Avoid UI testing for business logic validation
- Prioritize stable selectors (data-testid) over CSS/XPath

## 7. Test Data Management

### 7.1 Test Data Sources

- Mock data for unit/component tests
- Dynamic data generation for E2E tests
- Sanitized production data for staging environment

### 7.2 Data Maintenance

- Version control for mock data
- Automated data reset between test runs
- Data isolation between test suites

## 8. Risk-Based Testing

### 8.1 Risk Assessment

- Critical user flows (highest priority)
- Components with complex state management
- Third-party integrations
- Browser-specific rendering issues
- Performance bottlenecks

### 8.2 Risk Mitigation

- Increased test coverage for high-risk areas
- Exploratory testing for complex interactions
- Cross-browser testing for UI components
- Performance monitoring in the CI pipeline

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities

### 9.1 Development Team

- Implement unit and component tests
- Fix defects identified during testing
- Collaborate on test automation framework development

### 9.2 QA Team

- Design and execute test cases
- Develop and maintain E2E test suites
- Perform exploratory testing
- Report and track defects

### 9.3 DevOps

- Maintain test environments
- Configure and maintain CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor test execution and reporting

## 10. Test Deliverables

- Test plan for major features
- Automated test scripts
- Test execution reports
- Defect reports and tracking
- Test metrics and dashboards
- Performance test results

## 11. Test Metrics and Reporting

### 11.1 Key Metrics

- Test case pass/fail ratio
- Code coverage percentage
- Defect density
- Defect leakage to production
- Test execution time

### 11.2 Reporting

- Automated test reports after each build
- Weekly test status report
- Performance testing results
- Accessibility compliance report

## 12. Defect Management

### 12.1 Defect Lifecycle

- Identification → Documentation → Assignment → Resolution → Verification → Closure

### 12.2 Defect Prioritization

- Critical: Blocks functionality, no workaround, affects all users
- High: Major functionality issue, workaround exists, affects most users
- Medium: Minor functionality issue, affects some users
- Low: Cosmetic or enhancement, minimal impact

## 13. Timeline and Milestones

- Test planning: Complete before sprint planning
- Test case design: Concurrent with development
- Test execution: Daily as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Regression testing: Before each release
- Performance testing: Weekly and pre-release
- Accessibility audits: Bi-weekly

## 14. Appendices

- Lighthouse CI
- pa11y and axe-core
- GitHub Actions/Vercel deployment

### 14.2 Reference Documents
