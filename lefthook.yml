# Lefthook Configuration

pre-commit:
  # Defines a list of jobs to run for the pre-commit hook
  jobs:
    - # First job: lint-staged
      # The 'id' can be used for referencing, but Lefthook might infer from context or not require it for simple jobs
      # We'll name the job using a 'name' key if the schema prefers that, or just define the command.
      # Let's try defining the command directly if it's a simple job.
      # Based on the error, the items of this array are the jobs.
      run: pnpm lint-staged
      # If we need to name it explicitly within the array item:
      # name: lint-staged 
      # run: pnpm lint-staged

prepare-commit-msg:
  # Defines a list of jobs to run for the prepare-commit-msg hook
  jobs:
    - # First job: generate-commit-message
      run: python commit/commit_analyzer.py --hook
      # If we need to name it explicitly:
      # name: generate-commit-message
      # run: python commit/commit_analyzer.py --hook
